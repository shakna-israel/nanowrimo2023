# TODO

The man didn't say anything to Ivy.

He silently summoned a ship to come pick them up. A ship that offloaded a tour guide and a group of rich tourists, dressing up as if that would somehow make them not stick out like sore thumbs in a human society.

Truth was, most people don't want to notice. They assume it's a costume. A bunch of kids messing around, or a stunt for a movie, or anything but the truth. People like the peace of what they know.

Ivy was tempted to try and sneak off after the tourists, but the stubborn man never left her side. She was growing more and more angry with him, because he just didn't seem to be able to be... A person.

People might not always have a set of feelings, but people always try to treat you as a person, too. He wasn't just rude, he was utterly horrible. She survives a freak accident, one that should have killed her, and he just expects her to dust off and keep going?

It wasn't even an accident, it was attempted murder!

Someone tried to kill her, and his first priority was to get her back onboard, so she could be cleaning up after the freak who did this to her!

The craft jostled lightly as it took off, the two of them standing by the wall and holding onto a railing. She glared at the man, "What's your name?"

"No."

"I want to report you! Give me your name!" Ivy snapped.

"No."

She very nearly let out an angry his. He had a way of instantly getting under her skin. Maybe it was the darn helmet. His face couldn't be as expressionless as all of this. A furrowed brow, a twitch. Any of that would be better than a blank nothing.

"Fine, Mr. No. Who do you report to?"

"I am an Autonomous Security and Wellbeing Unit."

She frowned, "Security? So you report to... Jameson? Was that their name?"

"I am an Autonomous Security and Wellbeing Unit."

"You certainly didn't take care of my wellbeing when you knocked me in the pool!"

"I will review the cameras. If I really did such a thing, you will be compensated."

"Just apologise! You're like a toddler! Can't admitanything. Refuses to tell tjeir name. Are you six years old!?"

"No."

She rolled her eyes and gave up. "Just so you know, I hate you."

"I am sorry to hear that." He replied evenly.

She was tempted to jump on the word usage, but opted instead to ignore him.

When the smaller craft docked back with the cruiseliner, there was a man in a blue uniform, with a black skirt, waiting to take her to Management.

The rude Mr. No left without another word. Never so much as looking in her direction as he walked off to ruin someone else's day. Though, knowing her luck, he would be the perfect picture of politeness to the next person. He'd just have a problem with her.

The blue uniformed officer took her to a group of offices near the helm, and instructed her to take a seat like she was a naughty child. She did, but not because she was about to brush this whole thing under a bush.

She crossed her arms, leaves rubbing on her sunburnt skin, and put on her most furious of faces.

It had been easy to get angry at Mr. No.

Fronting her actual bosses that could expel her home at a moment's notice? Not so much.

She'd never actually met the real people in charge. She was just a maid. She was hear to scrub the deck, clean the rooms, and mostly be an invisible little house vaccuum puttering about the place. She wasn't supposed to be noticeable.

"Commander TODO will see you now."

All important people have secretaries. In this case, a secretary who appeared to be an almost melting bubble of blue skin, with eight coiling tentacles that were in constant motion around them.

Ivy stood up, took a very deep breath as the secretary reached over and opened the door from across the room, and very demurely entered the office. An actual military commander, titled rank, was about to chastise her.

Getting in early seemed the wrong way to go about it, so Ivy walked in front of the desk, spaced her feet apart, and put her hands behind her back.

TODO was sitting back in his seat, with two crossed feet up on the corner of the desk, and her personnel file open and in front of him. His brows were practically knitting together, as he murmured away unintelligibly to himself.

One claw tapped at the bottom of his chin, and the other on the piece of paper.

Seeing a crab species was always difficult for Ivy. The creatures were always so fascinating! They had independently evolved seven times on her homeworld, and that wasn't even a record. Sapient crabs were rarer, of course, but he could be from just about any planet.

There were some scientists that reasoned the crab was the most effecient species, and that was the reason that they always seemed to evolve everywhere. Some theologians posited that this meant the gods must be crabs, too. So life evolved in the image of the deity.

Other theologians, of course, suggested this meant crabs were dark, disgusting things. They were born as a result of sin in the world. Evidence of the corruption that had bled through and into everything.

Ivy could very easily write a whole book on the subject, without even learning anything new.

"Name? Pronouns?" He grumbled.

"Ivy Green. She and her." She replied stiffly, "Sir."

"Commander will do. Not sir. Now... What is this about you sneaking onworld?"
