# TODO: The TODO of TODO

Ivy scrounged her toes down into her pot, and looked over with a grin at the other two women settling into their new cabin, at the end of the workday.

Talia immediately dumped her uniform to the floor, and stomped off into the nearby shower. Desdemona smiling as she went, before lying back on the floor, still muddy and greasy.

"`Good evening, Mistress Green.`" Sudais stated, as a handful of small robots rolled out across the floor to begin cleaning up after them.

Ivy gave a strong yawn, "No chance at a little sun for supper, is there? Can't turn the ship. Can you get something for the other two, Sudais?"

"`A request to turn the ship has been issued, Mistress Green.`" Sudais said lightly, as if that was nothing, "`The chef has been instructed to provide two delightful meals, from Mistress Desdemona's homeland, and Mistress Talia's indicated tastes.`"

Desdemona let out a small cackle, "Darned be. This thing is fire."

Ivy leaned one elbow onto her knee, and dropped her head into her hand. Yawning and opening her flowers up. Smiling in an exhausted disbelief as the sun edged into view of the giant window, lighting her up as she chewed into its rays. "Luckiest... Girl... In the world..."

"Ya cute when you tired." Desdemona gave another laugh.

"I can hear you flirting out there!" Talia shouted from the shower.

Ivy didn't really take any notice of it. She was starting to feel like she'd found something like a family, here. People who didn't care that she was different, and were just happy to be around.

Even as her flowers were wide, her eyes fluttered shut.
