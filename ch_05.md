# TODO

Ivy winced at the bright lights, pulling back, and instantly hissed in pain as her leaves crinkled at the motion.

She moaned, bottom lip trembling, and looked around herself in confusion. The overhead light had all but burnt her, saturating her with far too much ultraviolet light. She tried to roll, to stand up, but a strong hand shoved her back onto the bed.

"Easy now, darling, easy."

She glared at the blurry figure, "Need... Water!"

"You're half-drowned, gal. You had more water than ya could darn handle." They replied gently, and brushed her cheek affectionately. "Probably a might uncomfortable, right about now. But you hooked up to a drip, to keep you drinking."

Ivy turned her head, following a small green vine that had grown out of her chest and up into a clear bag. She relaxed a little, recognising the medical set-up. "Med bay?"

"You are in the medical care unit aboard a Duffle & Hurley cruiseliner." The nurse confirmed, "You were brought in by an ASWU. Stuffy fellow with the black helmet."

She sat up and put both her hands to her chest in a panic, "The-the frog! He wants me dead! Wants to fuckin' eat me! Where's bloody Mr. No!? Why did he abandon me!?"

"Easy, gal. Easy." The nurse shook their head, "The guest has been remanded into secure custody. Eating a guest, twice, is not something to be overlooked. You have nothing to fear. Just lie back, relax, and take some time."

Ivy tried to slow her breathing, but the twisted memories that were beginning to surface... They told her that things might have been close.

She curled up inside her leaves, wished for some nice soil, and tried to find some sleep.
