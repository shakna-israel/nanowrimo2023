# TODO: The TODO of TODO

Ivy's head was still spinning at the mere possibility that Mr. No might actually have emotion, and that emotion was somehow fixed on her, when she stumbled out of the shower.

She was feeling a little drunk, from too much water, having spent too long in trying to think, leaving her tripping over her own feet.

The man had thrown himself off the side of an orbiting spacecraft, to make sure that she survived.

She was just a maid. It wasn't like Duffle & Hurley gave a flying damn about any of their lower deck staff.

On the other hand, she was getting special treatment. She didn't sleep on the lower deck, anymore. He could just be protecting against bad PR.

Except... Ivy couldn't see that infuriating man giving a damn about public relations. He kicked her into a pool.

Except he said he didn't notice he had.

Ivy gave a puff of irritation and kicked the side of her pot. She was frustrated, and thinking about it all had only made things worse.

Nearby, someone cleared their throat.

She looked up to see the other two women, waiting for her. Talia was making urgent pleasant faces, whilst the larger woman looked extremely uncomfortable and nervous.

Ivy had just shown that she was pissed off, in front of someone terrified to ask her out on a date. Not the best way to start things out, and if this didn't happen then...

Her thought cut off.

If it did happen, then she had a perfect excuse to tell the confusing Mr. No to keep his distance. Not the kindest reason to say yes to Desdemona, but it wasn't like Ivy wasn't going to give it her best shot.

Ivy did really want to discover what a romantic embrace from the intimidating sized woman felt like.

She gave a tired sort of smile to the other two, "Don't mind me. Just... Mr. No. Again. Can you believe that guy?"

"He dare do all." Desdemona chuckled, but not without showing some hesitance.

Talia jumped into the gap quickly, "We should go. You were telling me about... Chocolate? Earlier."

"What be chocolate?" Desdemona asked curiously, as the three women quickly fell into step with each other. With the largest woman in the middle of the three of them.

Ivy grinned, "Oh, it's amazing. Also going to clog our toilet, I'm afraid. I am really not meant to eat... But I am buying a whole... Brick? I can't remember what they call it. It's like this rectangle thing. So delicious. My professor used to bribe us with it. Anyone who aced the exams, got half a brick of chocolate."

"I not meant eat either." Desdemona chuckled, hesitated, and then put an arm around the smaller woman and squeezed her quickly. "But I be wanting this chocolate."

It didn't take long for the three of them to get to the landing craft. Security staff were scattered all about, pushing them into lines. Most of the other staff were still in uniform, most of them slightly dirty from the day's efforts.

Which was when Ivy finally noticed how the other two had dressed up. Ivy had just put on a light dress, with her usual knee-high boots. Something practical for romping around, but not all the way to the uniform she would wear on a dig site.

Talia was... Glamorous was the easiest way to put it. The bovine woman was wearing a dress that clung to her every curve, highlighting how shapely she really was. It also caught the light, sparkling with every moving breath of the woman.

On the other hand, Desdemona felt like she might be more at home on a pirate vessel, than a tourist one. Her outfit was made of leather, technically, but it felt more like various skins stitched together. It had steel clips that hung empty, but were clearly meant for some kind of weaponry.

To her irritation, Ivy noticed that it also had no space for a tail. Just straight pants of a warrior. She looked away quickly, so the other woman didn't notice her staring at their bottom. That would go down badly. Probably.

They stepped onto the visiting craft, and held onto one of the bars. The ship was just one large platform, out of which they could see the planet below. The Earth's halo almost seemed to glow as the ship jerked into motion.

Talia stared wide-eyed, and whispered, "I've never been to another planet."

"Only this one." Ivy grinned.

"I confess... I may have lied about never being another world." Desdemona said sheepishly.

Talia's eyes were fixed on the planet, but Ivy turned, "Really? You've been to another planet, before? You're our expert! You have to help us see everything."

"Never Earth. They not space species." Desdemona shook her head, "Mostly been trade hubs. Places family has business. It little fun. Never been to see things."

"Earth has something they call... Moving pictures." Ivy said, "They record themselves, acting out real or imagined stories, and then display them for the local populace. I think they last a couple hours? So a bit too long for one of our trips. But we might be able to buy one? I think."

Desdemona grinned, "Movies. This a thing I heard of. We have similar thing at home. Recordings of the heroes. Wars. I took first date at one. He tried to kiss me."

"My first kiss was in a field of flowers." Talia added, "His breath stunk like root rot."

Ivy hesitated, and the other two stared at her.

She sighed heavily, and scratched the back of her neck, "My first kiss...? Uh... TODO"
