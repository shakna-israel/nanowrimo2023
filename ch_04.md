# TODO

The door whooshed open, as Ivy held up a pair of hand clippers threateningly.

The black helmet revealed no emotion, as the guard viewed her. "I am reporting for duty. I am assigned to protect you."

"No."

"That is my correct designation. Thankyou."

She shook her head, "No, I mean... It's..."

The truth was, the only reason she didn't want him as her guard, was the awkwardness of it all. However, he had already proven himself. He'd crash-tackled her out of the air and saved her life, or whatever he'd done to make sure she woke up, alive, on the ground.

"Nevermind. Sorry."

"Apologies are unnecessary, but always appreciated."

Ivy looked at him with a lop-sided smile, "You're... Different. But I'm sorry that I've been as mean as I have."

"It is expected that one behaves in unusual manners, after encountering a life risking situation. It is not something to treat as if it were a normal situation and that the behaviour is of the regular attitudes."

She blinked, "Aha... So... Things still creeping and scaring the hell out of me. You're here because a guest wants to cut my roots. Um... Got any training for that kind of anxiety?"

"It may sound presumptuous to offer any advice."

"Please. Presume away."

The helmet inclined, looking her up and down, and her anxiety reached even greater heights. She could not at all figure what he might be thinking, and it felt leaf ruffling to have him wordlessly examine her.

"I would suggest a visit to the gardens."

Ivy blinked, "Gardens? Aren't there lots of hiding places there, for a really creepy guest who wants me dead?"

"I will be there."

Ivy had to laugh at his confidence. His arrogance really did not seem to have any limits. All the same, she did feel somewhat... Comforted. This was a man who could jump off an orbiting spacecraft without a hesitation. He was exactly who she wanted between her and some gardening shears.

She shrugged, "Lead the way."

He turned and walked quick-fast from the room, and she found herself skittering to keep up with him. Which, at least, was an excuse not to wear shoes. Her soft and still-healing feet just about danced on the warm textures of the floor.

They made their way up to the top deck again, and then moved to a small hallway near the official offices. Ivy followed him, surprised that such a place even existed. It didn't seem like the guests would really want to go here.

At the end of the hall, was a glass door, that led into a dome.

As soon as they stepped inside, Ivy had to bury a moan. Her first breath of air was so much more oxygen rich than she was used to. It set a fire burning through her veins, spreading out her leaves and exposing her completely.

She swayed, shivering, and feeling an unhealthy dose of euphoria. Her flowers hesitated for a moment, knowing that everything was off, but then they gave in and spread out - drinking in the rich air.

"This is an area that is not usually accessible by guests. It is unlikely the guest who has spoken threats against you can obtain access." The guard stated flatly.

She giggled and pushed his shoulder gently, "You're so serious all the time."

"I am an Autonomous Security and Wellbeing Unit."

"So?"

That darn helmet.

Couldn't see if he even blinked at her question, but he didn't answer it. Which annoyed her, and so with a giggle, she stepped close to him and grabbed the helmet from either side and tried to lift.

He didn't seem to respond, but the helmet didn't move a single inch, either. She struggled and pulled, but nothing happened. Ivy sighed, guessing that whatever was making her float, was also making her pathetically weak.

She turned away from him, and skipped down the path.

The plants surrounded them on all sides. Tall trees, and low bushes, all of them covered in flowers of every kind. These were genetic hybrids, bred and created by methods not available to nature.

Between the path and the plants were a small and low barrier, made from an ugly aluminium blend. She wasn't sure what, and her mind was spinning too quickly for her to snatch out any recognition. Why would they have a barrier?

It wasn't fair, and it wasn't nice.

She leaned her elbows onto the bar, looking out to the nearest tree, and then she began to softly sing. A light and airy voice, coming from somewhere deep in her chest.

> Sing with me, oh the garden's alive!

> Feel the warmth of the sun, hear the buzz of the hive.

> All of us together, in harmony,

> A living, breathing tapestry.

The notes of her song reverberated through the air. Slow and deliberate, carrying with them a sense of peace, tranquillity. As she sang, the garden around seemed to awaken. The flowers on the trees blossoming, the trees groaning and standing taller, leaves rustling in time with her melody.

All of the trees, except for the one right in front of her.

> Deep roots hold me to the earth.

> As long as I will live, I'll give birth,

> To leaves and flowers of every hue

> I am the garden, and the garden is me, too.

Her voice was higher pitched, but powerful. As she sang, birds that had been hidden away came out, flocking around her onto the path. Sitting and listening, before chirping along. Joining in the song, with their own sweet melodies.

> If high walls keep you from the sky,

> And you're feeling lost, wondering why,

> Come take a walk, let me show you where.

> Nature can heal, without a care.

The garden seemed to shimmer with a quiet energy, as it pulsed with life, seemingly magic. She continued to sing, notes rolling over the plants and creatures, filling them with a gentle spark.

It wasn't magic, of course. She didn't know if she believed in magic. It was science, and one that was rather basic. She was a catalyst, helping to smooth out the regular transformation processes within each living thing.

This wasn't much different to the first job she'd had, when she was still in high school. Someone had to tend the gardens for the fast food.

She turned to the guard, smiling brightly at him, before launching back into the chorus, trying to get that impassive helmet to listen, to act. To do something apart from feel like a giant lump of coal, resting angrily upon the ground.

> So sing with me, oh the garden's alive!

> Feel the warmth of the sun, hear the buzz of the hive!

> All of us together, in harmony,

> A living, breathing tapestry.

He didn't react at all.
